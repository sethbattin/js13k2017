I used a tool (that I built) to spin up an update/draw loop in a node project.  It uses webpack to uglify, and also zips the result for me.  The library includes a couple useful things like a zooming, panning 2d Camera and some input wrappers.  [nodeanimate](https://bitbucket.org/sbattin/nodeanimate)

I also use this to attach TODOs to this file:  [bash todo gist](https://gist.github.com/sethbattin/b20d03fbc4d099c70c09cce8124f378a)
